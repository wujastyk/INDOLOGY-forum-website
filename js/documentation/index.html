    </header>
    <article>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This website allows online access to all the contents of INDOLOGY, a Forum for Classical South Asian
            studies. This forum started as a <a href="https://list.indology.info/mailman/listinfo/indology"
                target="_blank">mailing list</a> in November, 1990.</p>

        <h3>Data description</h3>
        <p>The data is in plain text format, and the main language used is English. Besides English,
            there are other languages, as French, German, Sanskrit, etc., to name just a few, used to insert
            various words or expressions into the messages.
        </p>
        <h3>Data state</h3>
        <p>As of December 2022, the Forum contained 59,832 messages (69.4MB), and 325,565 words and
            mispelled words.
        </p>
        <h3>Data processing</h3>
        <p>In order to create the index for searching, some unused metadata and other redundant pieces of
            information were removed from the messages. However, the interface allows reading the raw contents
            of any message returned after a search, by pressing the link <code>full text</code>, located on
            the header of each message in the search result list.
        </p>
        <h3>Data storage</h3>
        <p>The whole website is a static website, which means that its pages or search results are not generated
            dynamically from a database, based upon a template, but are stored as they are in a filesystem, and
            served by a plain webserver. The same is valid for indexes used for searching. To
            query these indexes, a serverless search engine is used, which runs in browser.
        </p>
        <p>A static website has, among other advantages: free hosting, fast rendering, and a better
            protection against hacking.</p>
        <h3>Data searching</h3>
        <h5>Algorithms for fuzzy search</h5>
        <p>Due to the structure of the data, which contains mispelled words
            or simply words with non-ASCII characters that were replaced by the
            mailing list software with question marks, I found that, along with
            the exact search type, some fuzzy search algorithms are needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this reason, I have added the following fuzzy search types:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>prefix search, which will return all the words starting
                with the search term;</li>
            <li>two search types using Levenstein distance of one, respectively two differences
                (addition, deletion, or replacement) to the correct word form;</li>
            <li>ngram search, which uses an index built by segmenting the words in character bigrams (tokens of two
                characters), will return suggestions that are different by the search term based upon a similarity
                threshold
                having a fixed value of 0.7 (70%).</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Procedure for fuzzy search</h5>
        <p>In case when the exact search dows not return any or helpful results, one can
            extend the search by selecting one or more search types, to get more suggestions
            for each search term. After every changing of the search type, one has to press the <code>Search</code>
            button again. The search types can be combined.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the suggestions are convenient, one has just to select any combination of suggestions, and
            press the button <code>Search by suggestions</code>.
        </p>
        <h5>Search for expressions</h5>
        <p>
            Is it possible to search for expressions by surrounding them with double quotes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Is it also possible to make more refined search for expressions, by using the
            proximity search, which implies to find search terms separated a maximum or an exact
            number of words. For each of these searches, one can select if the words will be
            searched for in the same order they are entered, or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            The syntax is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>exact number of words, ordered, with two words between the search terms:
                <code>yoga o-exact/2 ayurveda</code>
            </li>
            <li>exact number of words, unordered, with two words between the search terms:
                <code>yoga u-exact/2 ayurveda</code>
            </li>
            <li>maximum number of words, ordered, with maximum two words between the search terms:
                <code>yoga o-max/2 ayurveda</code>
            </li>
            <li>maximum number of words, unordered, with maximum two words between the search terms:
                <code>yoga u-max/2 ayurveda</code>
            </li>
        </ol>
